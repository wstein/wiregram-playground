# Tasks: 001-wiregram-framework (initial)

## Phase 0: Research (R1–R5)

- [ ] R1: Implement regex-based lexer prototypes (Ruby + Crystal): `specs/001-wiregram-framework/research/lexer-prototype/` ✅ scaffolded
- [ ] R2: Implement RD parser prototypes and round-trip tests: `specs/001-wiregram-framework/research/parser-prototype/` ✅ scaffolded
- [ ] R3: Generator language PoCs (Rust/Crystal) — create `research/generator-language.md` (to do)
- [ ] R4: Create `specs/001-wiregram-framework/contracts/` skeletons (to do)
- [ ] R5: Implement benchmark harness and run baseline measurements (bench scripts added)

## Acceptance criteria
- R1 & R2 prototypes produce artifacts and tests that validate feasibility.
- R3 recommendation documented and accepted.
