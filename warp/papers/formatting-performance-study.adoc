== Abstract
This paper evaluates four formatting paths in the Warp PoC: tape-based, DOM-based, CST-based, and AST-based pretty printers. Benchmarks are run with max optimization on two JSON datasets. The results show that tape-based formatting provides the highest throughput and lowest latency, especially in the parse+format path.

== Implementation Variants
* Tape-based pretty printer: `Warp::Format.pretty(doc : IR::Document)`
* DOM-based pretty printer: `Warp::Format.pretty(dom : DOM::Value)` via `Parser#parse_dom`
* CST-based pretty printer: `Warp::Format.pretty(doc : CST::Document)` via `Parser#parse_cst`
* AST-based pretty printer: `Warp::Format.pretty(node : AST::Node)` via `Parser#parse_ast`

== Methodology
* Bench harness: `scripts/benchmark_format.cr` (run with `--release -O3`)
* Warmup: optional CPU stress prelude (no per-case warmups)
* Timed iterations: 5 per case
* Metrics: average ms/iteration, throughput MB/s, output bytes
* Host: local Apple Silicon development machine (PoC environment)

== Datasets
* `spec/fixtures/jsonc_example.jsonc` (100,653 bytes)
* `spec/fixtures/rcl_test.json` (19,001,368 bytes)
* `spec/fixtures/twitter.json` (631,515 bytes)

=== Dataset Characteristics
* `jsonc_example.jsonc`: medium JSONC with line/block comments, trailing commas, mixed language strings, and emoji escapes. CST output grows because it preserves comments/trivia, while DOM output shrinks due to normalized string escapes and comment removal.
* `twitter.json`: smaller but string-heavy, with high escape density and many short keys/values. This inflates pretty output size (indentation + escaped content) and emphasizes string processing cost.
* `rcl_test.json`: large, mixed arrays/objects with more numbers and long lists; lower relative string escape density. This shifts the bottleneck toward structural formatting and traversal overhead.

These differences explain why output sizes and throughput diverge across datasets. DOM formatting expands normalized string escapes, while tape/CST preserve raw slices when possible, so string-heavy inputs show larger size deltas.

== Discussion
* Tape-based formatting is consistently faster than DOM formatting in end-to-end parse+format across all datasets.
* CST parsing adds overhead for comment-aware tokenization; AST costs are higher due to CST construction plus AST allocation.
* Tape-only formatting is fastest overall; CST/AST output sizes are larger because the CST formatter preserves trivia when present.
* DOM output size differs when unescaping/re-escaping string escapes; tape and CST preserve raw slices, which is more visible in string-heavy inputs like `twitter.json` and JSONC fixtures.

== Recommendations and Ratings
[cols="3,5,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Suggestion |Rationale |Impact |Rating
|Prefer tape-based formatter for tooling |Highest throughput and lowest latency without CST/DOM allocation |High |5/5
|Use CST formatting for JSONC |Preserves comments and trivia in JSONC |High |5/5
|Expose minify overload for `IR::Document` |Completes tape-based formatting path for CLI tools |Medium |4/5
|Document escape behavior differences |Avoids surprises when tape/CST output preserves raw slices |Medium |4/5
|Add optional unescape mode for tape formatter |Gives predictable output when required |Medium |3/5
|Add streaming-friendly formatting API |Supports large files with lower peak memory |Medium |3/5

== Conclusion
In the PoC state, tape-based pretty printing materially outperforms DOM-based formatting. The tape path is the recommended default for high-throughput formatting tools, while DOM formatting remains valuable for workflows that require materialized data structures.
