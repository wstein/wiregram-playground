This guide documents the transition of Warp's Ruby support from a minimal prototype to a robust, industrial-strength parsing pipeline.

== Overview

Warp's Ruby support now mirrors the architecture used for Crystal, featuring a high-performance Pratt parser, a linear Tape IR for lossless formatting, and comprehensive introspection tools.

== The Pratt Parser

The original Ruby parser was a simple recursive descent implementation that struggled with operator precedence and method call chaining. We replaced it with a **Pratt Parser** (Top-Down Operator Precedence).

=== Key Features
* **Operator Precedence**: Correctly handles arithmetic, logical, and member access (`.`) operators.
* **Method Chaining**: Expressions like `root.not_nil!.children.map` are now correctly parsed into a nested `MethodCall` hierarchy rather than a flat list.
* **Block Support**: Handles both `{ ... }` and `do ... end` blocks as part of method calls.
* **Red/Green CST**: Maintains the lossless Lossless Syntax Tree (LST) invariant.

=== Example: Method Chaining
[source,ruby]
----
root.not_nil!.children.map { |n| n.kind }
----
The Pratt parser processes this as:
1. `root` (Identifier)
2. `.not_nil!` (MethodCall on `root`)
3. `.children` (MethodCall on result of 2)
4. `.map` with block (MethodCall on result of 3)

== Tape IR (Internal Representation)

Warp uses a **Tape** structure to represent the source code as a linear stream of entries. This is the primary input for the structural scanner and the formatter.

=== Ruby Tape Builder
The `Warp::Lang::Ruby::Tape::Builder` converts the CST into a linear tape of `Entry` records:
* `trivia_start`: Offset to leading whitespace/comments.
* `lexeme_start`: Offset to the token itself.
* `lexeme_end`: End of the token.

This allows the engine to reconstruct the source exactly (lossless) or apply transformations while preserving surrounding trivia.

== Developer Introspection (CLI)

To assist in debugging and further development, several CLI flags have been added to the `transpile` command.

=== Usage
[source,bash]
----
bin/warp transpile crystal --dump-cst -s source.rb
----

=== Available Dump Flags
* `--dump-tokens`: Prints the raw token stream with positions and lexemes.
* `--dump-cst`: Displays the hierarchical Concrete Syntax Tree.
* `--dump-ast`: Prints the high-level Abstract Syntax Tree (Object Model).
* `--dump-tape`: Shows the linear Tape IR entries.
* `--dump-simd`: Visualizes the structural character positions used for SIMD acceleration.

== Implementation Roadmap

1. [x] **Pratt Parser Implementation**: Completed for core Ruby expressions.
2. [x] **Tape Generation**: Implemented Ruby-specific tape builder.
3. [x] **CLI Tooling**: Integrated debugging flags.
4. [ ] **Semantic AST Bridge**: Mapping CST nodes to semantic `Warp::Model` objects (In progress).
5. [ ] **Corpus Validation**: Running the existing `corpus/ruby/` through the new pipeline.
