This repository keeps the Ruby reference implementation at the project root.
Additional language targets live under `ports/`.

== Targets
* `ports/jruby` - JRuby experiments and wrappers.
* `ports/crystal` - Crystal PoC CLI and library prototypes.
* `ports/kotlin` - Kotlin PoC CLI and library prototypes.
* `ports/common` - Shared fixtures and cross-language artifacts.

== Notes
These ports are exploratory. Expect incomplete implementations and frequent
changes.
